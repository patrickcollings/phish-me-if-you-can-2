These sort of scams are trying to get you to pay money for a service that you may actually have by scaring you into action. In this case by saying that you have already paid a lot of money for a renewal. They will then get you on the phone to extract money from you.",

This is quite a clever scam where they show you the whole link in full. But when you click the link it will actually take you to a different website. This is why it's important to double check a link AND the URL of the website you arrive at.",

The scammers were able to use a real address to send the email so these sort of scams you have to be very wary of. If it seems too good to be true then it probably is.

In this case a scammer is pretending to be someone else in the company but they are using a Gmail account instead. They use urgency to force someone in the finance department to make a transaction on their behalf without checking with their boss to see if it's real first. ALWAYS double check, before sending money to anyone.",

It is very well worded and someone has clearly put a lot of effort in to it but there is a few giveaways: mentioning that 'this isn't illegal', talking about all the money we can make and using industry jargon (such as the chemical compound: Gedoroxin Herbal Extract G 55) to make themselves seem official and trustworthy. This is one of those scams that is just too good to be true therefore somethings not right. You have to ask yourself why would this person email a random stranger from the internet asking them to do this.",
